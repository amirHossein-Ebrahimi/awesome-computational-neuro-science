## DoG & Gabor in Convolution

- [x] [Gabor Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter)
- [x] [Difference of Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians)
- [x] Feature map
- [x] Detect dominant lines and features, and show improvement and precision through time

## Unsupervised STDP Learning

- [x] Implementation Unsupervised STDP Learning
- [x] Plot delta weights caused by STDP learning for two neuron with random excitation
- [x] Generate 10x2 Spiking Networks & learn Two 10th-tuple by each output neuron
- [x] Add an inhibitory neuron to upper network

## Full object detection model based on spiking neural network

Model trained and tested on [caltech101](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/caltech101) dataset

> Caltech-101 consists of pictures of objects belonging to 101 classes, plus one background clutter class. Each image is labelled with a single object. Each class contains roughly 40 to 800 images, totalling around 9k images. Images are of variable sizes, with typical edge lengths of 200-300 pixels.

We presents an deep spiking nerual model which consist of 3 layer. for first two layer only STDP learning is used, and for last layer dopamin releases followed by STDP and anti-STDP.

**For more documentation see code, documentation will be updated**
