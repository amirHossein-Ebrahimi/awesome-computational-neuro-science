### tools
* [Auryn](https://github.com/fzenke/auryn) is a C++ simulator for recurrent spiking neural networks with synaptic plasticity. It comes with the GPLv3. `SIMULATOR`
* [BindsNET](https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet) is a Python package used for simulating spiking neural networks (SNNs) on CPUs or GPUs using PyTorch Tensor functionality. `PACKAGE`
* [BrainPy](https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainPy) is an integrative framework for computational neuroscience and brain-inspired computation based on Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation (built on the top of JAX and Numba). `FRAMEWORK`
* [GeNN](http://genn-team.github.io/genn/) compiles SNN network models to NVIDIA CUDA to achieve high-performing SNN model simulations. `PERFORMANCE`
* [Long short-term memory Spiking Neural Networks (LSNN)](https://github.com/IGITUGraz/LSNN-official) provides a [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 1.12 library and a tutorial to train a recurrent spiking neural networks (LSNN). The library focuses on a single neuron and gradient model. `LIBRARY`
* [Nengo PyTorch](https://github.com/nengo/pytorch-spiking) a thin wrapper for PyTorch that adds a single voltage-only spiking model. The approach is independent from the Nengo framework. `LIBRARY`
* [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/introduction.html) is a neuron simulator, and Nengo-DL is a deep learning network simulator that optimised spike-based neural networks based on an approximation method suggested by [Hunsberger and Eliasmith (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05141). `SIMULATOR`
* [Neuron Simulation Toolkit (NEST)](https://nest-simulator.org) constructs and evaluates highly detailed simulations of spiking neural networks. This is useful in a medical/biological sense but maps poorly to large datasets and deep learning. `SIMULATOR`
* [PyNN](http://neuralensemble.org/docs/PyNN/) is a simulator-independent language for building neuronal network models. It does not currently provide mechanisms for optimisation or arbitrary synaptic plasticity. `SIMULATOR`

* [decolle](https://github.com/nmi-lab/decolle-public) implements an online learning algorithm described in the paper ["Synaptic Plasticity Dynamics for Deep Continuous Local Learning (DECOLLE)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10766) by J. Kaiser, M. Mostafa and E. Neftci. `ALGORITHMS`, `UTILITY`
* [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch) is a Python package for performing gradient-based learning with spiking neural networks. It extends the capabilities of PyTorch, taking advantage of its GPU accelerated tensor computation and applying it to networks of spiking neurons. `PACKAGE`


### Tutorials
* [Computational Neuro Science](/tutorials.md) Jupyter notebook tutorial Series for Spiking Neural Networks ðŸ”¥
* [Spiking-Neural-Network](https://github.com/Shikhargupta/Spiking-Neural-Network) is the pure python implementation of hardware efficient spiking neural network. It includes the modified learning and prediction rules which could be released on hardware and are energy efficient. Aim is to develop a network which could be used for on-chip learning as well as prediction.
